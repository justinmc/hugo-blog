<p>While working on the website for <a href="http://www.aiesecmichigan.com/">AIESEC Michigan</a>, a student organization I'm in, I wrote a cool html/css/javascript scrolling image bar that I&nbsp;thought I'd share.&nbsp; It takes a normally static title image bar that you might see on a typical website and gives it a nice lively touch by scrolling to a new image every few seconds.&nbsp; It's similar to the different game announcements you see scrolling on <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>I tried to make it as easy to use and customizable as possible, so you can easily change the speed, frequency, size, and obviously the content being scrolled.&nbsp; It should work in pretty much any similar configuration you want it to.</p>

<p>I'm hosting it for the world to use on github, so if you'd like to see the source code and documentation, head over to <a href="http://github.com/justinmc/jQuery-Open-Carousel">my github page</a>.&nbsp; Also check out <a href="http://www.aiesecmichigan.com/">aiesecmichigan.com</a> if you'd like to see it in action!</p>
