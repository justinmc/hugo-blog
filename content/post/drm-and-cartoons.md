    DRM sucks.  I've been trying to remove all of it from my iTunes music since I have an	 				 	
    unfounded yet surprisingly strong negative disposition toward downloading music illegally. 				
    Luckily, I actually succeeded today using an amazing program called Requiem (Google it, though it 		
    might be a bit tough to find a legitimate torrent file).  The Windows version was a bit sketchy,		
    but the Mac version seemed to work fine and decrypted (almost?) all of my music losslessly.  		
    Now I can Audiosurf and listen to my music on my Ubuntu partition to my heart's desire.  Awesome.

    In other news, the webcomic site I have been working on is coming along nicely.  I 							
    still need to decide on a good name and url, though.  "Monday Morning Cartoons" is what I had 			
    originally come up with, but it fit better when I planned to scan all the cartoons from a 				
    notebook.  Now I've come up with a new theme.  I have made all the cartoons so far using GIMP,			
    so the webcomic has a more slapped-together-using-MS-Paint type feel.  Should work out fairly			
    well and also coincidentally supplement my awful hand drawing skills.  My cartoon library is 			
    still fairly small at the moment, but looking on the bright side, this is due to lack of GIMP			
    time, not lack of ideas.  Anyways, I plan to launch a beta version soon on my school hosted				
    webspace until I get a domain and everything finalized.  Link coming soon.
