<p>The website is pretty much back to normal now.&nbsp; I've reentered all of  the data I could find, which I believe was actually all but one or two  of the original entries.&nbsp; Again, huge thanks to <a href="http://lazarus.interclue.com/">Lazarus</a> for saving all my old form data.</p>
<p>I'll try to post a bit more about my internship in Austria and life in general as my senior year gets going.&nbsp; And when I&nbsp;finally have the time, I'll update this blog engine like I've been planning!</p>
