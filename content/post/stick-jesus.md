    After a bit of a lull in cartoonage over at <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markups </a> , we are 
    back in business with a new cartoon I came up with after finding myself applying Sun Tzu's great work to my
    RTS game strategy.  And later this week I should have a new cartoon out featuring none other than Stick Jesus
    Himself.  Good stuff.

    Also, I recently finished Crysis Warhead and feel the need to give my opinions.  Overall: a pretty good game,
     go get it if you liked the first.  The story is probably the most changed aspect of the game, being told in a
     much more cinematic way.  I won't say better story than Crysis because it misses some of the drama compared to 
     the first in events that happen in both, but it is definitely told in a more interesting manner.  There is some 
     new gameplay stuff, but it doesn't change the game that much.  The mulitplayer does feel different, however, or 
     at least the new team deathmatch does.  In a good way.  Power struggle is a bit tweaked and fun as ever, also.
     Finally, I actually did not hardly notice a difference in the game's visuals, though it may just be my system 
     because a lot of big reviewers have reported Warhead being more efficient.  So overall, if you found yourself 
     going back to the original and replaying certain moments, or the multiplayer, get this game and you will not
     be disappointed.
