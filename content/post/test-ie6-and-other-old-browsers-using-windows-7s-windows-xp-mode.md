I'm always testing sites in different browsers, and besides the expected
 headaches caused by browsers like IE, I also tend to waste a lot of 
time just getting everything I need running.  With this setup I started 
using, you can test IE6, IE7, and more in a way that's 
free, officially supported by Microsoft, and allows you to have all of 
the browsers you want installed at the same time.<span id="pastemarkerend"> </span><br>

<br>

  You'll need a computer running Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, 
or Ultimate (because Microsoft only let's you run Windows XP for free on 
these editions.  Otherwise you may need your own copy of Windows XP.).
<br>

<br>

  Start by installing Microsoft's virtual machine software that runs 
an instance of Windows XP for you, called Windows XP Mode (part of 
Microsoft Virtual PC).  This is available free from Microsoft here: 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a>
<br>

<br>

  Once you have that going, start up the virtual machine.  If the 
default IE isn't what you want to test with, just hop online and 
download whatever browser you need.  You can get a copy of ancient IE6 
here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1</a>.
<br>

<br>

  Want to create another virtual machine with another browser ready 
to go?  That's also possible.  I used this nice tutorial to set up 
second machine for IE7:

<br>

<br>

  Now you have multiple virtual machines with different old browsers 
in them.  You can start one up, test in it, and switch to another or to 
Windows 7 without needing to uninstall and reinstall any browsers.  
That's by far the most convenient way to test old browsers that I've 
been able to come up with.  Happy testing!
