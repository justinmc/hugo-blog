<p><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }</style></p> <p>Well it 's been awhile since I talked about what I 'm doing in life, so here 's what 's going on.</p> <p>I finished winter semester long ago, bringing an end to my junior year.&nbsp; In the hope that my senior year will be manageable, I&nbsp;stuck around Ann Arbor and took a few classes during spring term.&nbsp; This also ended just a few weeks ago, bringing the dreaded two month period which must be filled with a job.</p> <p>I submitted easily over 30 applications during junior year and spring term and heard back from hardly any.&nbsp; But just as spring term ended, I&nbsp;found myself fortunate enough to have 3 job offers on the table.&nbsp; The one I&nbsp;chose has me programming a web application at the Graz University of Technology, which is in Austria. &nbsp;I will definitely be writing about this trip in the Travel section, so expect that soon because I&nbsp;leave tomorrow (if my visa comes in the mail in time for me to catch my flight).</p> <p>I 've also been able to enjoy life moreso than usual since I haven 't had class for the past 2 weeks.&nbsp; I got to take a roadtrip to DC to visit friends with internships there, saw a bit more of the mystery that is Michigan outside of Ann Arbor while camping, and went to Chicago for a day (ok that one was because I&nbsp;had to go see the Chicago consulate for my visa).</p> <p>Now that we 're all caught up, I 'll be writing about Austria as events occur.&nbsp; Which will hopefully include catching my plane tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
