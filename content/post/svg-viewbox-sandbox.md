<p>Awhile back I wrote an <a href="http://justinmccandless.com/blog/Making+Sense+of+SVG+viewBox%27s+Madness">article about SVG viewBox</a> after being confused by it for so long.  Just recently I went back and wrote a live updating sandbox app in React that allows you to quickly play around with different viewBox setups and see the result instantly.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://justinmccandless.com/demos/viewbox/index.html">live demo here</a> and see if you can follow  how different changes to viewBox and preserveAspectRatio affect the SVG.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/justinmc/svg-viewbox-sandbox">source code</a> is also available on Github.</p>

<p>And of course if you're still thoroughly confused by viewBox after all of the above, definitely take a look at my article <a href="http://justinmccandless.com/blog/Making+Sense+of+SVG+viewBox%27s+Madness">Making Sense of SVG viewBox's Madness</a>.</p>
