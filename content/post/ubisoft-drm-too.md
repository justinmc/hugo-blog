<p>
    So it seems that Ubisoft is following EA and using DRM similar to Spore's (and Crysis Warhead's, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
    Clear Sky's) on its upcoming title Far Cry 2.  Which sucks.  I don't care if I am never going to have to install the
    game more than five times, I DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD HOW I AM ALLOWED TO PLAY MY GAMES.  And while we're at it, I don't
    want to have to validate my games online, and I don't want to have SecuROM installed on my computer.
    </p>

    Now that that's settled, I would really like to know why.  Why are publishers using this crap?  It's not stopping
    pirates!  I really can't think of a good reason why a publisher would do this, especially Ubisoft AFTER seeing the
    massive retaliation against its implementation on Spore, law suit included.  If I had to guess I'd say it has more
    to do with some business deal crap than the the publishers thinking it's a great idea.  SecuROM was created by none
    other than Sony, so I'd guess it's a "You buy our DRM software and we'll help you out by..." type of thing.

    But who knows, maybe the publishers aren't targeting pirates, maybe they're just targeting the everyday consumer
    who might pass his recently beaten game around to his friends after he's done with it.  If you think about it, there
    are far more of this type of consumer than there are pirates, this type of consumer probably does not even know what
    DRM is, and this is exactly the type of thing that they are stopping, NOT pirates.
    </p>

    Whatever the cause, I really hope the community backlash continues, and maybe these publishers will get the point.  
    The word needs to be spread about DRM, since I would estimate that only a small fraction of video game consumers
    even realize that it exists.  Oh, and I'll be first in line 22 October to give Far Cry 2 my personal review on 
    Amazon.
