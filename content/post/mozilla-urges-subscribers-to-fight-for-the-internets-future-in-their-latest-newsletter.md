<p>
	Mozilla&#39;s newsletter just came out a few hours ago, and (in addition to online shopping tips) they&#39;re informing their readers about the US Congress&#39;s Stop Piracy Act.&nbsp; Right at the top they call the bill &quot;bad for you and the internet - terrible, in fact&quot;.&nbsp; They go on to list a couple of ways the bill will affect the average Firefox user and to show what they can do to help.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re at all interested in this, you should check out what the legislation is specifically about (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">wikipedia article</a> is a good place to start).&nbsp; It&#39;s easy to get lost among the big companies, organizations, and politicians yelling things at each other, but the bill itself doesn&#39;t exaggerate.</p>
<p>
	To me, the bill seems like it targets a reasonable concern, but goes way too far in using powerful censorship as the solution.&nbsp; The main concern I get from it is that there are a lot of foreign websites violating US copyright law, with American online advertising money paying them, and the US is powerless to stop the sites.&nbsp; This is a legitimate concern, I&#39;m sure you know the websites the bill is talking about that allow you to download copywritten American media illegally.&nbsp; It&#39;s also true that in the heaps of ads on these pages, American advertising companies are paying the sites to run.&nbsp; Maybe the copyright holders should be able to file a complaint or something to have the advertising company remove the ads since the US government can not easily hold the foreign website accountable under US law.&nbsp; This would be a reasonable idea to debate.&nbsp; But the Stop Piracy Act goes way further than this.</p>
<p>
	Under the proposed bill, a complaint filed by a copyright holder could also result in search providers being forced to remove the infringing website from its results and internet service providers being forced to block access to the site.&nbsp; This is full out censorship as far as you can go, and it&#39;s for something as small as copyright violation.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even see why such powerful measures would be suggested to resolve this problem without other motives for opening up this kind of censorship.&nbsp; And besides this speculation of what could happen with abuse of this power, I don&#39;t want the government forcing censorship on any pages, even if they are illegal ones that I don&#39;t want to visit.</p>
<p>
	For me, this bill has some serious censorship hidden under the guise of &quot;stopping online piracy&quot;.&nbsp; After trying to do some unbiased research into it, I&#39;m of the opinion that it is absurdly powerful for the problem it&#39;s trying to fix.&nbsp; So thank you to Mozlila for bringing this bill to the attention of more people, and to the supporters of the bill, talk to me again when there is a bill that reasonably wants to combat online piracy, and not just set a censorship precedent.</p>
