<p>
    Supreme Commander 2 was announced last night and I am excited.  Square Enix will be publishing, which is pretty
    crazy, and hopefully they'll give Gas Powered Games the support they need to crank out something awesome.  I
    really can't imagine what this game is going to be like comparing Total Annihilation to Supreme Commander as scale,
    but it should be awesome.  It just might be a long time until we actually see the game.  That's ok, though, I will
    be on GPGnet playing Forged Alliance in the mean time.
