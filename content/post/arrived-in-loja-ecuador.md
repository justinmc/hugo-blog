<p>
    I have officially begun my internship in Loja, Ecuador, and so far it has been pretty awesome.  This is still just a 
    quick post, though, because free time with laptop connected to internet is short.  In fact, I am currently writing
    this while offline, and I plan on ftping it to the server tomorrow while at work.  This is also my plan for 
    <a href = "http://www.turkiball.com">turkiball.com</a> (sorry already deathly slow work internet).
    </p>
    <p>
    But not to make a completely useless post, here is a more or less chronological order list of some of the things
    I've done so far:    
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> Met a bunch of really cool people from UTPL, the university who I'm intercambio-ing with through 
         <a href = "http://www.aiesec.org">AIESEC</a>.
    <li> Started my job at Fundaci&oacute;n Ecologica Arcoiris.  I would have linked that one too but not until I redesign the
         website, my first task since starting work there.
    <li> Helped fix a visitor house's water supply (a stream in the jungle) in Podocarpus National Park.  That one was also part of
         my job, which is amazing, I never thought I would find a job that combines html with hiking outdoors.
    <li> Drove through roads covered by fog, landslides, and cows for two hours to translate something to English.
    <li> Hung out in Malacatos with AIESEC friends, ate way too many oranges out of trees, and chased a chicken.
    <li> Drank sugar cane juice while overlooking Vilcabamba, the Valley of Longetivity.
    </ul>
    <p>
    I'm really hoping this post gets me in the pattern of my writing offline posting at work plan.  I'll post more about
    all the above in detail, and maybe with pictures if I <em>really</em> want to hog my work's internet.  Adios.
