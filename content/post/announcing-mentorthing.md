<p>Today marks the soft launch of a project I've been working on with some friends called <a href="http://www.mentorthing.com/">Mentorthing</a>.  I work on a lot of side projects for fun and for a technical challenge, but this one I'm really hoping can make a difference for a few people.</p>

<p>The idea behind Mentorthing is to create an open platform where anyone can put themselves out there as a mentor, and anyone else can seek their help as a mentee.  No vetting process or exclusivity whatsoever.</p>

<p>I don't need to tell you how valuable a good mentor can be in any sort of education, but the problem is access to mentors.  The current avenues that students and learners have for finding a mentor are often exclusive and antiquated, like alumni or corporate mentorship programs.</p>

<p>Mentorthing hopes to be an inclusive platform, where knowledgeable people can declare to the world that they're willing to help, and anyone has the ability to strike up a conversation and see if they could benefit.  It's a system that I really hope can help a few people achieve their goals.</p>

<p>We're a small community that's just starting out, so if this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to sign up and <a href="http://www.mentorthing.com/">check it out</a>.  No pressure, you're totally able to just put in your info and wait and see if anyone is interested in talking to you.  It's a work in progress, so feel free to reach out to me personally with suggestions or other ways to get involved.</p>
