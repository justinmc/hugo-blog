<p>
    That's right, <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markup Cartoons </a> is
    officially online.  It's also currently sporting a few new cartoons courtesy of me,
    and a fancy search and random function courtesy of 
    <a href = "http://www.ohnorobot.com"> ohnorobot.com </a> .  Now I just need to work 
    on the slightly lacking favicon that pales in comparison to the beauty of the "Mc"
    favicon on this site.  And once I get that beast out of the way I'll start slaving
    away at the cartoons, so expect those to start multiplying pretty soon.  I'll try
    to whip out as many as I can before I head back to school in *gasp* 4 days.
