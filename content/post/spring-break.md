<p>I have officially finalized my plans for Spring Break, and I will be going to Guatemala.Â  The point of the trip is to work on setting up a solar power system for a school in a remote region of Guatemala.Â  I kind of randomly stumbled upon the trip, which is sponsored by a student organization here and a local nonprofit, and now I wound up deciding to go.

<p>
It should be a lot of fun, though.Â  It will only be a 9 day trip, but I should have a bit of time to check out the towns we'll pass through and stuff while I'm not recording measurements of the school for my CAD drawings when I get back.Â  And IÂ will be able to practice my Spanish a bit, which I unfortunately don't have the opportunity to do very often in Michigan.
</p>
<p>
I may not have the opportunity to update this blog much while I'm there like I did in Ecuador, but at the very least I will post a ton of stuff when I get back.Â  I know that I'll have the opportunity to use computers at the hostels we'll be staying at, but still, I might not have the time to write massive updates and post pictures.Â  I'll definitely try though.
</p>
<p>
The trip is already only a few weeks away, but similar to my visa problems last year, I now have a passport problem that I have to rush to take care of before IÂ depart.Â  Hopefully that won't be a problem when we're looking to depart...
</p>
<p>
I'll post some more details of the trip as it gets closer.Â  I believe I'll be leaving the 27th of this month, and I'll be gone the whole break which means no time to go home.Â  I'm sure it will be worth it though, and regardless of what IÂ end up doing for the summer, I will be back home when I finish class in April.
