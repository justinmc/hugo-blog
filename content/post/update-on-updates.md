<p>I finally got my web-based updater software up and running for this blog.  This was kind of the whole point of the transition to php and MySQL, despite being delayed a bit.  Basically, it makes it really, really easy to update the site.  Evidence: I am currently writing an entry about a writing entries.</p>
<p>I can now add new entries to this blog using a simple form from any web browser.  Since the php version of this blog went online, I had been updating it by directly accessing the database using phpMyAdmin, which was not quite as convenenient (though still a lot better than the all hand-written html days).  The vast majority of the code I used is courtesy of the recently launched <a ref="http://www.arcoiris.org.ec/">Arcoiris</a> web update system, which I have been writing and revising for the last couple of months to allow the folks at the fundaci&oacute;n to be able to maintain that site on their own once I leave.</p>
<p>I also mentioned before how I wanted to get some feeds going on this site, and it actually looks like it's getting closer to happening.  Due to my insistence on incorporating feeds at Arcoiris, I actually have a fair bit of work done on a rss/atom system already.  If all goes well I'll port that system over to here when I'm done too.</p>
<p>And one last item to add to the wish/disappointment list, I'd like to get a Files section for the main site and for every category, so that all pictures and other files ever posted in the entries will be easy to find and access. That is definitely needed.</p>
<p>Alright, well hopefully I'll be posting on this thing all the time now that it's so easy.  Hasta pronto.</p>
