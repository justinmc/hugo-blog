    My flight back to Ann Arbor is only a week away as of today... I can't wait to be back
    in Ann Arbor, but I'm also going to miss all this free time!  I don't think my websites
    will be neglected horribly, but my video games definitely will be...  And the fact that
    I will be reunited with my desktop makes it twice as bad.  I'm really going to miss 
    Anthem skatepark too, and vert skating in general!  I'll try to get some good street 
    in before the winter comes in Ann Arbor, though.  Oh, and I need to do some last minute
    four wheeling before I leave!  I always miss the desert.

    Ok, now that all that whining is out of me, I am really looking forward to seeing
    everybody I met in Ann Arbor again, the cool weather, and the next season of Michigan 
    football.  And ok, going back to school itself should be alright too.

    On the cartoon subject, the site got a nice new layout using divs, looks awesome.  Also,
    the random and index buttons both work, so I'm running out of reasons to hold off on
    getting a domain.  And lastly, a new cartoon is up, though I may change the final frame
    because I have two and can't decide which is funnier.
