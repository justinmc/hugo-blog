<p>
    Ok I'm posting this because I may be able to help some of the many many Far Cry 2 customers who have not been able
    to play the game they forked over $50 for (like me).  I was previously having the whole crash to desktop after the 
    splash screen problem that has had gamers damning Ubisoft on forums all over the internet.  This may be able to fix
    a few other problems as well, however.  Here it goes.
    </p>
    <p>
    So what you need to do is edit the file that tells the game what settings to load on start.  This file is called:    
    </p>
    <p>
    GamerProfile.xml    
    </p>
    <p>
    And it is located at:    
    </p>
    <p>
    C:/Users/'username'/Documents/My Games/Far Cry 2/    
    </p>
    <p>
    All the settings that are able to be edited in the Video settings part of the options menu are able to be edited
    from here without starting the game.  My problem was the Fullscreen setting, which was set to "0".  I changed it
    to "1" and the game started fine.  There are many other settings you can mess with if this doesn't work.  I'd try
    changing the directx version if fullscreen doesn't work.    
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyway, just thought I'd throw that up to try and help some frustrated customers out there like myself. There is 
    really limited info on the internet right now about locating that configuration file. If anyone has any questions
    or anything at all, shoot me an email at <a href = "mailto: justin@justinmccandless.com"> mcjustin@umich.edu </a>.
    Good luck.
    </p>
