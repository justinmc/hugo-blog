<p>
    Where has the summer gone?  And what am I doing on a computer on my last full day
    left in Las Vegas???  I guess I'll just count this as easing myself into Michigan
    again as I prepare to take EECS 280.  Anyways, 
    <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markups </a> got a nice new makeover.  
    Yeah, I can't help myself, I come up with a completely new and better design for my
	 websites every couple of weeks.  Also, 
	 <a href = "http://www.theelectronicshandyman.com"> The Electronics Handyman website </a>
	 should be closing down here pretty soon.  I need to figure out what I need to do to 
	 cancel my business license, too.  Hmm, better hurry.  Oh, and I might put up a nice 
	 farewell message in place of the website for now.  We'll see; right now I'm going to 
	 eat some of the last authentic Mexican food I'll have in a while.
