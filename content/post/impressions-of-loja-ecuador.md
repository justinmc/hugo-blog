<p>Another important yet neglected topic.  I've posted a bit about Loja before, but now I have some pictures to go along with it.</p>

<p>This is a cool park near the house.  Note the llamas.  You can sort of see one of the rivers that runs through town in the picture.  There's a dam that makes a small lake in it for this park.  Lots of typical houses and stuff in the background, as well as that castle that I went to earlier up on the mountain on the left.  I really need to go back to that castle with my camera so I can take pictures of the city by the way...</p>

<p>Obligatory Loja picture.  This is the clock tower in San Sebasti&aacute;n plaza.  It's in a pretty popular area downtown, with lots of shops and stuff surrounding it.  The pictures on the base of the tower comemorate Loja gaining it's independence from Spain.</p>

<p>A typical downtown street near San Sebasti&aacute;n.  And some cars.  You can see a bit of the mountains that surround Loja in the background.  The building to the right is a really nice church, well, the side of it.</p>

<p>And lastly we have some sunset scenery from outside of Loja.  This is what the typical terrain around the city is like. The picture was taken at the  <a href="http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/38.php">finca</a> that I went to the other weekend.  That's Conan towards the bottom.</p>
<p>Ok, writing this post about Loja actually just reinforced what I said at the beginning.  I have neglected Loja too much and I need to take more pictures of it, because I don't have much more than these four here.  I'm still missing big landmarks like the Parque Central, and Jipiro...  I'll get on that.</p>
