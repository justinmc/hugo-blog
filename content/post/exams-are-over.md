<p>I just finished my last midterm (for awhile) yesterday, so that equals a bit more free time for me, which     equals a bit more cartooness for <a href="http://www.markupcartoons.com/"> Markups </a>.  Today we have     all of my pent up anger against my Blackberry Curve manifested as a cartoon.  It's a great phone, and I love     it, but it does tend to freeze, and lag, and turn off randomly in the middle of phone calls occasionally.     I really can't see myself going back to a dumbphone, though, so yeah, it's a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Speaking of my Blackberry, I really want to post a comprehensive guide to the game Brickbreaker up here one     of these days.  That's right.  It's not stupid cellphone game whose outcome depends only on how many lives      decide to randomly fall from the sky, it is an intense game of complex strategic destruction.  Or at least     that's what I tell myself when I'm winning.  Anyway, we'll see if that happens.</p>
<p>And last but not least I'd like to say a few words about the Michigan-Toledo game today.  It sucked.  But      football aside, at half time the Michigan marching band rick rolled the entire Big House and it was the      funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Besides <a href="http://markupcartoons.com/cartoon19.html">      Anthrax Sniffing Dogs </a>.  But yeah, I think I was one of the few people in my vicinity who understood      what a rick roll was (not enough engineers around), but I thought it was hilarious.  I love our band...</p>
