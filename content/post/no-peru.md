    Peru ended up not working out last weekend due to the other interns finding out at the last minute that their
    visas didn't let them leave the country during the time they're supposed to be here.  So I stayed here in Loja
    and got some work done, which was good, but I still have the problem of my winding down time to legally be
    in Ecuador.  I think I'm going to end up heading to Peru solo, hopefully next weekend.  I'm trying to find
    out some info about someone who has apparently done this before so I know what the heck I'm doing when I show
    up to the Peruvian border all alone.

    At Arcoiris there is actually another volunteer now, from France.  She's here I believe with a friend and
    her boyfriend, and she'll be working at Arcoiris for the next month or so.  It's actually really cool having
    another foreigner there at the office since I never really see any of the other AIESEC volunteers around
    during the week.  And it's pretty cool speaking Spanish with someone who's native language isn't Spanish or
    English.

    Last but not least, the updates to this blog.  They're coming.  Every time I remotely get something done, I
    think of 5 more things I'd like to do as well.  It doesn't help that I work on websites all my waking hours;
    anything I think of that's cool for some other site I immediately want to do here.  Anyway, when it's done it
    should be pretty nice and much, much easier for me to update.  Back to work.
