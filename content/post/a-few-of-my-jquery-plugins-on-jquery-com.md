<p>
    Two of my more complete jQuery plugins are now up on jQuery's plugin site.  Check out <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/openCarousel/">jQuery Open Carousel</a> and <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/fastButtons/">jQuery Fast Buttons</a> over on the recently relaunched plugin site.  They're also both on <a href="https://github.com/justinmc">github</a> as always.
</p>

<p>
    I've written a good amount about these projects on this blog before, but here is a basic overview of each.
</p>
<br />
<h2>jQuery Open Carousel</h2>
<p>
    jQuery Open Carousel is an easy to use carousel that's lets you do a bunch of configuration and customization without touching the javascript.  It's also pretty well commented and nicely written in coffeescript to make hacking it to advance uses just as easy.

</ul>
<br />
<h2>jQuery Fast Buttons</h2>
<p>
    jQuery Fast Buttons speeds up the click event in jQuery Mobile for some browsers that add a 300ms delay (like iOS).  It's a simple project but it can provide a very nice performance upgrade, which you can see on its great demo page.

<h2>Coming Soon...</h2>
<p>
    I have a couple of older projects that are still very cool and useful.  I'll hopefully dust them off and post them on the plugin site soon too.
