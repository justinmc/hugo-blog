<p>
    The beta version of my webcomic site is up!  Going strong with four cartoons and only two
    broken links.  The cartoons are subject to change, too; I need to add emphasis to some
    things and make sure the colors don't clash with the colors of the site...  But, hey, 
    I've got a prototype, so progress is being made.  Oh, and the links that don't work are the 
    random button and the index link, which has yet to be created.  Check it all out via the 
    links page!

    Also, about the name, it has changed to "Markup Cartoons", which I kind of like since it pays
    homage to the sketchiness of the cartoons and also the nerdiness of their subjects.  It still
    may change, though, we'll see.

    Expect a lot of changes, many new comics, and maybe even a real domain to come for the webcomic,
    and also probably some visual changes for this here blog in the near future.
