    So <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markups </a> got a new cartoon last night making fun of 
    a popular topic of late: Our impending doom at the hands of the LHC.  Another cartoon that vaguely
    relates to aliens is currently in the works and should be out sometime this weekend.  Assuming the 
    dudes at CERN don't start creating any black holes between now and then.

    I also have become aware of yet another formatting issue involving this here blog.  It seems that it
    can look prety effed up if viewed under the extreme conditions of "using Internet Explorer", so I'll 
    hopefully get that fixed this weekend also.  Wow, this post is starting to resemble my homework agenda...
