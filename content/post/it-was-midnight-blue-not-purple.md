    After trying a whole lot of crap to fix the whole Internet Explorer inconsintency, I finally just
    decided to update the whole look of the website and hopefully resolve the problem as a side benefit.
    And luckily it worked.  So, yeah, this is the new website.  Umm, feel free to use Internet Explorer
    or whatever.

    <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markups </a> received a few new cartoons during this
    barren period of IE problem fixing.  They're pretty awesome, check 'em out.  I also have a few new 
    cartoons in the works, I just haven't had the time to finalize any of them... Soon, though.  I'll
    hopefully have a new one out before Monday.

    Also, I had a bunch of things I wanted to post to the blog recently, but I decided to hold off
    writing anything new until the new version was launched.  So my point is, perhaps I'll have some
    crazed ravings or something up here soon instead of the usual boring posts about my html problems.
    Till then.
