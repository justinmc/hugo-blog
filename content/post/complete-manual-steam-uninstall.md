    I ran into a problem awhile ago involving Steam.  I always had it installed on my external hard
    drive, which is usually connected to my laptop, to save space on my boot drive.  I then took my
    trip to Ecuador, leaving my external drive at home.  Because Steam was installed on a currently
    non existent drive, it wouldn't run (obviously), but more importantly it also refused to uninstall.
    And last but not least, after downloading a new install client, it also wouldn't let me install it
    anew on my internal drive.

    This could be a massive problem for someone with a failed external drive, etc., so here is my
    solution.  After deleting every last Steam involved file that I could find on my computer and
    getting the same results as before, I realized the problem must be with registry entries made
    by Steam.  And it was.  Luckily Valve provides an amazing guide on how to delete these entries
    using regedit.  Here's the link:

    After deleting these entries I was able to use the install client like normal to install Steam
    on my internal drive and reunite with my long lost games.  Hope everything goes as well for you,
    if not feel free to contact me as always:
