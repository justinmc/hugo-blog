<p>I'll be competing in <a href="http://www.indiespeedrun.com">Indie Speed Run</a> for the next 48 hours, so I wanted to keep track of my progress here on my blog.  After a very fun but very rookie time at Ludum Dare just a few weeks ago, I'm really hooked on building small games and hope to put something even cooler together this time.</p>

<p>You can view <a href="http://www.indiespeedrun.com/profile/justinmc">my profile</a> on the Indie Speed Run site, but I'll be posting all my updates right here over the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>I just hit the go button a few minutes ago, so my deadline is 9:47pm Tuesday night (China time).  Tonight I've just written a bit of generic code and done a lot of brainstorming.</p>

<p>Indie Speed Run works by giving each participating team a unique theme and element to build a game around at the time of the competition.  My theme is <b>Escape</b> and my element is <b>Elevator</b>.  A pretty sensible combination considering it was generated randomly.</p>

<p>I've just gotten excited about a horror themed idea that we came up with, but we'll see what that turns into.  I have some nice boilerplate down for an isometric 2D game in <a href="http://craftyjs.com">craftyjs</a>.</p>

<p>For now though, I'm off to sleep on the situation and let the details come to me by tomorrow.  I'll be up early for more coding and more updates.</p>
