    Did you notice?  Yeah, the site got a much needed makeover.  Check out that finger 
    trap/navbar to the left, pretty fancy.  Other than a few minor changes, this should
    be the layout for a while, so now I can quit worrying about design and focus more on
    just writing entries themselves.  And the webcomic.  Sweet.
