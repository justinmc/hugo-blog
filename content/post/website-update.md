<p>
    The long, long overdue updates to this website are finally almost here.  I should seriously have them up
    by the end of this week.  There is still tons more I want to add, but what I have now is just about fully
    functional and is still an immense improvement so I'm pushing it out the door.
    </p>

    Don't get too excited though, it's actually very similar to the old site in terms of appearance.  But it
    has been restructured and rewritten in every other regard, and due to the wonders of php and MySQL it should
    be much easier to maintain.  So only I'm allowed to get excited.

    Anyways, I'll post back when it goes live.  And I'd also like to post some tutorial type stuff on what I
    did, or some source code, or something like that.  After that it's time for
    <a href = "http://www.turkiball.com">Turkiball.com</a> 
    to get redone for the fall.
