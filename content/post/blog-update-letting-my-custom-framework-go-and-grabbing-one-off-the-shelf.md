<p>While never getting quite as much love as I would have liked to give it,
 this blog has been here while I recorded my life for the past five 
years or so.&nbsp;  I started it as an undeclared freshman to graduated 
electrical engineer, living in four different countries.<span id="\" pastemarkerend\""=""> Something.</span></p>

<p><span id="\" pastemarkerend\""="">
And for the first time, I've moved the blog off of a 100% custom hand coded platform and onto a framework.<span id="\" pastemarkerend\""=""></span></span><span id="\"><span id="\"><br>

</span></span></p>

<p><span id="\"><span id="\">Why the change?<span id="pastemarkerend">&nbsp; At the time I wrote the first draft of this site, I didn't actually have that much interest in keeping a blog.&nbsp; I even&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="/blog/First+Post">registered this domain without having an idea of what I would put on it</a> <span id="\"><span id="\"><span id="pastemarkerend">.&nbsp; But the reason why I wound up spending hundreds of hours of my time coding this site, probably significantly more time than I've spent writing posts, is just because I wanted to learn.&nbsp; This blog has always been a platform for me to learn about web development, and the decision to move to Cake PHP continues this.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="\"><span id="\"><span id="pastemarkerend">Years ago I started laying out the site in pure html and css, just to learn the art of hand-writing html.&nbsp; Yes, some of the earliest posts still on the site I wrote as a plain .html file and updated all forward/back and archive links by hand.&nbsp; When I got sick of that (quickly) and had html and css down, I started learning server side scripting by writing short helper programs to automate some stuff for me.&nbsp; There was a time when this site consisted of reusable layout in separate .html files, posts in .txt files, and everything was tied together by a couple perl scripts.&nbsp; When I understood CGI scripts and these smaller bits of code, I moved on to writing a complete, though limited, PHP framework for the site.&nbsp; This is still visible in the history of the site's </span></span></span><a href="https://github.com/justinmc/justinmccandless.com">github page</a>.&nbsp; While working with Ruby on Rails and other commercial frameworks for more serious projects, thanks to this blog I could say that I not only understood how to use the framework, but how the framework actually does everything it does.&nbsp; Understanding this, I knew that I could never fully rewrite the code written and maintained by the huge communities surrounding these frameworks.&nbsp; I knew that I understood the roots of these huge projects however, and I accepted that it was time to leave my old methods behind again.</p>

<p>Leaving behind an old piece of a project that I've worked so hard on is never easy, but it makes perfect sense following my original reason for creating the blog.&nbsp; I want to use it as a platform to learn, and now I <i>can</i> easily say that my time is better spent learning the huge scope and industry trends and norms that I can from a commercial framework than it is rewriting and revising low level functions that someone else has done better many times before.&nbsp; I have always been a low level, from scratch type of programmer by nature, which is probably why I chose to study electrical engineering.&nbsp; Even though a lot of web development is more on the human side than the silicon and bits side, I can say that I understand much more of what's in between thanks to this blog.<br>
