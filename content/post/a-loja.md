    Well, it looks like I'll be heading to Loja, Ecuador, for an internship this summer.  Which is pretty friggin' sweet.
    I should be able to scrounge up some internet somewhere so that I can continue to work on my websites.  I especially
    want to write about my experiences and stuff on this here blog, so get ready for that.  I should be leaving early
    May.

    In related news,
    <a href = "http://www.turkiball.com">turkiball.com</a>
    is coming along nicely, while also consuming most of my html writing power /makingexcusesfornotupdatingblog.  Lots
    more to come on that one as well.

    Oh, and please enjoy Empire: Total War, Street Fighter IV, Darkfall Online, and all the other awesome new games that I
    will not be able to play due to impending exams/Ecuador internships.
