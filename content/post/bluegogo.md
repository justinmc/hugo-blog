I just posted a review of the bike share service Bluegogo over on Medium, which you can check out <a href="https://medium.com/@justinjmcc/a-review-of-bluegogo-bike-share-in-sf-ee4c0934d156#.ua0u2jo6x">right here</a>.

As someone who's interested in transportation and especially bicycling, I had a lot of fun biking around town trying out the service, taking pictures, and writing about my experience.  I've been longingly looking at the Bay Area Bike Share stations for awhile, sad that they don't make any financial sense for my use cases, so I was happy that something new has come to town.

Enjoy the article, and hopefully I'll have some new tech stuff for this blog shortly.
