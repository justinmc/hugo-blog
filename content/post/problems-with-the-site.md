<p>justinmccandless.com has been down for the last few weeks, and a good  amount of my entries are gone.&nbsp; This was due to domain.com, my  ex-hosting company, canceling my hosting while I was in Austria after a  failed payment due to a change of credit cards.&nbsp; This makes sense, but  they also permanently deleted my databases, which wasn't cool.</p>
<p>Thankfully,  I had backed up my database in the middle of summer 2009 after  realizing the tragedy that would be if I ever lost my database.&nbsp; Along  with the help of a few entries lying around my computers as text files,  and the miracle working Firefox extension <a href="http://lazarus.interclue.com/">Lazarus</a>, I also plan to recover at least a few more entries.&nbsp;  I'll be working on patching up the site, recovering entries, and trying  to transition to a started Version 6 of the site going forward.</p>
<p>Some  good did come out of this misfortune, though.&nbsp; For one, I learned to  religiously back up my databases.&nbsp; I also was able to change hosting,  which I&nbsp;had been thinking about for awhile until this provided me the perfect opportunity.&nbsp; I now have my own virtual cloud server from <a href="http://rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>,  which is working out quite nicely so far.&nbsp; I basically have my own  Ubuntu server, with root access, that I can set up and manage 100%  myself, for about the same price as before.&nbsp; After picking up some basic  sysadmin stuff at my internship this summer (more on this shortly,  there was so much I&nbsp;wanted to write but  couldn't due to this site being down), I much prefer being to install my  own packages, manage Apache on my own, and not have to go through a  dumbed down browser interface.&nbsp; Plus I can use the server for many  things besides web hosting.</p>
<p>Anyway, old posts will return soon, new posts will be written soon, and hopefully I'll get this site in shape shortly.</p>
