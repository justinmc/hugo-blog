    After a lot of carrying heavy things and screwing with computers (not to mention a
    particularly uncomfortable flight), I am finally settled into my new dorm at the U of 
    M.  Still haven't gotten Ubuntu to position itself correctly on my desktop connected
    to a Vizio LCD as a monitor, but at least it still works on my laptop.

    Both this blog and <a href = "http://www.markupcartoons.com"> Markups </a> have been
    slightly adjusted size wise after I realized that not everyone keeps their display 
    at a 1920x1200 resolution like I do.  I also became aware of a terrible position
    issue with the blog that for some reason never showed up on my laptop using Firefox,
    only on just about every other computer that tried to view the site.  Whoops.  That
    should be fixed now though.

    I will hopefully get back into the swing of posting up new cartoons any day now.  
    Today was the first day I was actually able to sit down and work on my websites, but
    from here on out I should be able to get back into a regular routine.  I'll keep you
    posted.
