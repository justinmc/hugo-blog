Webgl is starting to bring a lot of cool 3d content to the web.  You'll see [3d tours of new cars](http://kadjar.littleworkshop.fr/), [full 3d games](http://webassembly.org/demo/), and [a shop for 3d characters with in-browser preview](https://www.mixamo.com/).

All of the above are separate 3d applications, but is Webgl affecting the everyday 2d web?  At this point the answer is not much.  Despite the wide browser support nowadays, user interfaces have very rarely been improved with 3d or even with fancy looking 3d gimmicks.  Why not?  Let's go ahead and try to build a fun 3d effect that could be stuck into a static website and see how it goes.
